                        Any request for registration will be subject to an e-KYC (electronic-Know Your Customer) procedure. We do this for a number of reasons, including to check your identity and to meet our legal and regulatory requirements.

                        -<br />
                        You can also send money to any bank account abroad falling within our coverage by selecting the bank transfer option in the Account tab and providing the required information, such as the account number and IBAN. If money transferred by you to another account is not paid into that account and is returned to us, and if we had to perform a currency exchange during the original transfer, we will convert the returned amount back to the original currency.

By requesting a MYMONTY Card, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the Card Terms.<br />

                        (a) You can instruct us to initiate a currency exchange of the Available Balance or any portion thereof from one currency to another. The available currencies for such exchanges are Fresh LBP and Fresh USD.<br />
                        (b) The exchange rate is set by our partnered exchange house and is based on the real market rate adopted at the time of the conversion. You can always see the real-time exchange rate in the App, and the transaction history of your Account will indicate the exchange rate adopted to execute a transaction.<br />
                        (c) You assume all risks associated with currency conversion and agree that we are not responsible for any losses, including exchange rate fluctuations, fees, or other related charges incurred during the currency conversion process. It is recommended that you carefully consider the prevailing exchange rates and any associated costs before initiating any currency exchange or making payments in foreign currencies.<br />
                        (d) While we recommend that payments to and from your Account are made in the preferred currency of your Account, you can activate the auto-exchange feature on your Account. This feature will automatically convert the required amount from the other currency in your Account to cover a purchase when your preferred currency balance is insufficient. This conversion will take place at the checkout of the Merchant at the prevailing market rate, including any applicable fees, at the time of such payment is executed. This means that your Account might be credited with more or less than you expected, and we won&#39;t be responsible for any losses if this happens.<br />
                        3.5<br />
                        Limits and Fees<br />
                        (a) We may impose limitations and fees for each transaction, including on the receipt, payment, and withdrawal of funds into or from your Account, as well as the withdrawal or spending limits and fees for using your MYMONTY Card, at our reasonable discretion.

                        4<br />
                        we will assume you are happy with the change unless you tell us you want to close your Account before the change takes effect. By accepting these Terms, you authorize us to debit your Account for any applicable fees.<br />
                        (b) You acknowledge that certain third parties, such as banks, may impose fees on inbound or outbound transactions. We hold no responsibility or liability for such fees, as they are determined and imposed solely by the respective third parties.<br />
                        3.6<br />
                        Transaction Handling<br />
                        (a) Your transaction may be declined if you do not have sufficient funds in your Account to cover the transaction amount and the applicable fees. You cannot cancel or revoke a payment or transaction instruction that has already been received by us, nor can you withdraw your consent to execute a transaction.<br />
                        (b) Before you send money to someone or make a transfer, double-check that you have the correct recipient details. If you send money to the wrong person because of a mistake in the information, we cannot take responsibility for it. We&#39;ll try to help you get your money back with no guarantee of success.<br />
                        (c) Transactions between MYMONTY accounts are credited instantly. The processing time for other transactions will vary and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Please note that we will not be responsible for the funds until they are received by us.<br />
                        (d) We reserve the right to reverse a transaction if the payer, the payer&#39;s bank, or the payment service provider initiates a reversal or if there is a reasonable likelihood of such a reversal being initiated in relation to your Account. In the event of a reversal, we retain the right to deduct the reversed transaction amount from your Account balance. If your Account balance is insufficient to cover the reversal, we may request repayment from you.<br />
                        (e) When carrying out a transaction through any of our Agents, you may be required to provide proof of a valid identification document to the Agent or any other information to verify your identification to match your Account.<br />

                        4.2<br />
                        We will send a notification to your Device to inform you of any incoming or outgoing payments, transactions, or transfers. The transactions will be displayed in your online transaction history on the App together with the date of receipt (the credit value date) and the fees charged (the &ldquo;Transaction History&rdquo;).

We do not and shall not be obliged to provide you with a physical or written confirmation in respect of any transaction. You should regularly check your Transaction History for comprehensive information on your transactions.<br />
                        5.<br />

                        You are responsible for ensuring the utmost security and integrity of your Account and your MYMONTY Card and take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorised or fraudulent use of them.

                        5.2<br />
                        To ensure the highest level of security for your Account, it is essential that you implement or arrange for the following precautions:<br />
                        Conceal PINs in a manner that makes it difficult for others to decipher.<br />
                        Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, telephone numbers, or predictable number sequences as PINs.<br />
                        Prohibit the storage of security details on any Device.<br />
                        Regularly change the PIN to access your Account and the MYMONTY Card PIN.<br />
                        Secure the Device used to access your Account and prevent unauthorized use of it.<br />
                        Refrain from utilizing any functionality, whether Device or software specific, that allows for the storage or automatic retrieval of Account Credentials.<br />
                        Ensure that the Account is securely logged out after each use.<br />
                        Download the latest software for your Device and the latest version of the App as soon as they are available.<br />
                        <br />
                        5.3<br />
                        If at any time, you believe that your Account, MYMONTY Card, Credentials or the Device used to access the App have been stolen, lost, or compromised (as applicable), it is imperative that you promptly notify us and report the incident to seek immediate assistance. Taking swift action is vital to mitigate potential risks and protect your Account and MYMONTY Card against unauthorized use or fraudulent activities.

                        6<br />
                        5.5<br />
                        We shall not be held liable for any unauthorized access to the Account or any associated damages that may result. While we take reasonable measures to ensure the security of our Platform, you acknowledge that no system is entirely immune to potential risks or unauthorized intrusions, especially considering that all transactions are processed by automated methods.<br />
                        5.6<br />
                        We reserve the right to implement security measures, including but not limited to monitoring Account activities and transactions, in order to protect your Account and its users from fraudulent or unauthorized activities. You hereby consent to such monitoring and acknowledge that we may take appropriate actions, including blocking or suspending Account access or closing your Account, if any suspicious or unauthorized activities are detected. You will solely assume full responsibility for any fraudulent, unauthorized, or otherwise improper use of the Account or your MYMONTY Card. We shall rely on the authenticity and authority of all instructions received by us through the Account and may act upon such instructions.<br />
                        5.7<br />
                        It is recommended that you regularly review your Account activity, statements, and transactions to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activities promptly.
